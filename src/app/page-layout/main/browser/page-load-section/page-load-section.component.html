      <h3 class="article_list-heading">Step 0. <br> URL Validation in the Browser Address Bar</h3>
      <p class="article__cell-paragraph">
        Before processing a URL, browsers perform quick validation:
      </p>
      <ul class="article__list">
        <li class="article__list-item">Check if input is a valid URL – If it starts with
           http://, https://, or a domain format, treat as a URL.
        </li>
        <li class="article__list-item article--warning">If not, treat as a search query
           – Pass the text to the default search engine.
        </li>
        <li class="article__list-item"> Auto-Correction – Adds https://, fixes typos
           (e.g., "gogle.com" → "google.com").
        </li>
        <li class="article__list-item">
           Security Checks – Blocks known phishing/malware sites and warns about unsafe HTTP.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3 class="article_list-heading">1. DNS Resolution</h3>
      <p class="article__cell-paragraph">
        The first step is resolving the domain name in the URL (like example.com)
         into an IP address. This is done through a Domain Name System (DNS) lookup.
          Your browser asks a DNS server to translate the human-readable
           domain into a machine-readable IP address.
      </p>

      <h3 class="article_list-heading">2. Establishing a Connection</h3>
      <p class="article__cell-paragraph">
        Once the IP address is known, your browser establishes a network connection
         with the web server. Typically, this involves setting up a TCP connection,
          and if the site uses HTTPS, a TLS handshake follows to secure the connection.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="article__cell"  >
      <h3 class="article_list-heading">3. Sending the HTTP Request</h3>
      <p class="article__cell-paragraph">
       With the connection established, your browser sends an HTTP request to the server
        asking for the specific resource (usually an HTML document). This request
         includes headers that provide additional context, such as the browser
          type and accepteonnection.
      </p>
    </div>

     <div class="article__cell"  >
      <h3 class="article_list-heading">4. Server Response and Resource Download</h3>
      <p class="article__cell-paragraph">
       The server processes the request and sends back an HTTP response containing
        the HTML content and response headers. Upon receiving the HTML, the browser
         begins downloading it. However, the HTML often references other resources
          like CSS files, JavaScript files, images, and fonts. The browser sends additional
           HTTP requests to fetch all these assets in parallel to build the full page.
